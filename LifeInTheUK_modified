\section{A Long and Illustrious History}
 


\subsection{Early Britain}

\begin{enumerate}
\item 10,000 years ago:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Stone age Britain. Hunter-gatherers. Came when Britain was fused with the continent. 
		\item Prehistoric village: Shara Brae
	\end{itemize}
	\item 6,000 years ago: First farmers, Stonehenge located in Wiltshire 
	\item 4,000 years ago: Bronze age, dead buried in round barrows
	\item 2,500 years ago: Iron age 
	\item Romans
		\begin{itemize}
			\item 55 BC failed invasion by Caesar
			\item 43 AD successful invasion by Claudius, lasted till 410 AD. Scotland never conquered
			\item First Christian communities. Romans left to defend other parts of empire
			\item Hadrian's wall kept out the Picts (Scots). $2 \times$ forts: Vindolanda and Housesteads.		
		\end{itemize}
	\item Year 600: Invasion from Northern tribes, Jutes, Angles and Saxons in what is known as England. Wales, Scotland preserved independence. 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Anglo-Saxons were converted to Christianity by missionaries: St Patrick (Ireland), St Augustine sent from Rome and 1st archbishop of Canterbury
			\item Anglo-Saxon is basis for modern day English language.
		\end{itemize}
	\item Year 789 and Viking invasion: Anglo-Saxon kings continue to dominate England bar partial (east/north) invasion by Vikings from Norway and Denmark in 789.  Danish king (Canute) ruled only briefly.
	\item Year 1066: Norman conquest by William the Conqueror (from Normandy), mainly England. Norman French influenced English language. Final conquest. Battle of Hastings (English army lost, King Harold died) documented in the Bayeux Tapestry. William ordered a survey of England (the Domesday book). 
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Middle Ages}

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Up to 1485: middle ages. Constant period of war.
		\item England fought with Wales and Scotland and Ireland. They also fought abroad in the crusades. 
		\item The 100 Years War (116 years) vs France, where England eventually won in Bataille d'Agincourt, 1415. Stayed in France but left 1450s. 
		\item 1348: Black death (plague) which killed 1/3 of population
		\item 1215: First hint of a parliament. Magna Carta developed (aka the Great Charter), in which the King's powers were limited. Defines terms of the King's rule. He now had to consult with the nobility before taking key decisions. Lords: great landowners, nobility, bishops. Commons: knights and wealthy people from town and cities, subject to elections. Similar structure arose in Scotland. First legal system (judges) ruling independently from the rulers based on precedence. 
		\item $\approx 1400$: assertion of national identity through English as a new unified language: Anglo-Saxon (peasants) fused with Norman-French (nobility) to form English. Canterbury tales printed by Caxton and 1st book printed in English.
		\item An important trading nation: ppl come to England to work, e.g. glass from Italy, weavers from France, engineers from Germany and 
		\item 1455: Civil war (of the roses) Lancaster (red) and York (white). Henry Tudor won (red) in Battle of Bosworth but cross marriage (now allies). 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{The Tudors}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Henry VII limited the powers of the nobility, reverses effect of Magna Carta, more power concentration for the King
 		\item Henry VIII (1491-1547)
 			\begin{itemize}
 				\item Henry had six wives (1st wife, Catherine of Aragon, 2nd wife Anne de Boleyn famously executed in Tower of London). 
 				\item broke away from Catholic Church in Rome to get a divorce Catherine of Aragon as she could not have any child, creation of Church of England
 				\item Same time: reformation/Protestantism on the continent
 				\item Wales reunited with England
				\item Ireland fought over attempts to impose Protestantism 
		\end{itemize} 			 
 	\item Bloody Mary: Henry's son Edward (from 3rd wife) died early. Edward's half-sister ``Bloody'' Mary (from 1st wife) took over. She was Catholic and persecuted Protestants.  She also died early.
 	\item Elizabeth I (from 2nd wife Ann de Boleyn) came to power and most popular Monarch of English history
		\begin{itemize} 		
			\item she was protestant and made peace / restored church of England
			\item she defeated in 1588 the Spanish Armada who came to impose Catholicism (commander Sir Francis Drake lead the battle)
			\item Catholic Mary queen of Scots fled after she was accused of murdering her husband. Her cousin Elizabeth I didn't trust her motives and locked her up in Tower of London for 20 years + execution. 
		\end{itemize}
	\item King James and the Plantations: when Elizabeth died her cousin from Scotland king James VI became king James I of England. King James bible. 
In Catholic Ireland, England was in control by now. Irish people opposed Protestantism. English government encouraged Protestants to settle in Ulster (Northern Ireland), taking over land from Catholics. "Plantations''. James organized several such plantations - seed for Irish conflict.
	\item King James and son Charles vs the Parliament: these monarches managed parliament poorly. Believe in absolute power of the King. Charles ruled without them for 11 years. He tried to impose a prayer book on Presbyterian church in Scotland leading to Scotland invading England. Charles asked Parliament for help, but the Puritan members said no. Tension in Ireland too: another rebellion by Roman Catholics. Parliament now demanded control of British army. Charles entered parliament (last monarch to do so) to arrest Puritan members but they had fled $\Rightarrow$ Civil war broke out in 1642. 
	\item Advent of the Republic, 1649: King Charles lost and was executed. England became a Republic (Commonwealth). General Oliver Cromwell went to Ireland to defeat royalist army / establish parliamentary rule. Very bloody. In Scotland Charles son (Charles II) was proclaimed king. Started invasion of England. Cromwell beat him and Charles II fled to Europe (hiding in oak tree). Cromwell now ruled as Lord Protector till his death. 
\item Restoration time: Charles II back in 1660, friend of parliament. Habeas Corpus act (right to court hearing). Formed Royal society. Isaac Newton.  Great fire in London destroyed St Paul's cathedral, rebuilt by Christopher Wren.
\item King Charles II succeeded by brother James II who liked Catholicism. 
\item Glorious Revolution: James II's daughter Mary married to Protestant William of Orange (Netherlands). William asked by protestants in England to invade. Led to Glorious Revolution / no fighting / restoring parliament. James II went to France. He briefly invaded Ireland with French army but was defeated. Also some support for James in Scotland. 
\end{enumerate}

	\item 1695: newspapers allowed to operate without government license.
	\item Two party system 
	\item Queen Anne and the Act of Union of 1707: daughter of William and Mary had no surviving children which created uncertainty for succession $\Rightarrow$  Act of Union agreed in 1707 creating Kingdom of Great Britain (Ireland excluded and still separate country). Scotland, although no longer independent, got to keep Presbyterian church. 
	\item George I Anne's nearest protestant relative, German George I, became king. Bad command of English, so he had to rely on a Prime minister (Walpole - the first!).
	\item George I's son George II had to deal with clan rebellion in Scotland. Clans lost. After that Highland Clearance wherein small farms destroyed to make way for sheep and cattle. Many Scottish left for North America. Robert Burn (1759-96) famous Scottish poet - Auld Lang Syne.
